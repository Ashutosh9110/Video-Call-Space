Can you explain the use of   const pathname = usePathname(); and const isActive = pathname === item.route || pathname.startsWith(${item.route}/);

in the Navbar.tsx


const pathname = usePathname();
usePathname is a Next.js hook from next/navigation.
It returns the current URL path as a string.
Example values it could return:
/ (home page)
/upcoming (upcoming page)
/recordings/some-id (nested route under /recordings)

Purpose:
It helps determine which page the user is currently on.


2. const isActive = pathname === item.route || pathname.startsWith(\${item.route}/`);`
This checks if the current page (pathname) matches the navigation item's route.
It also checks if the current path starts with item.route/, which allows highlighting active links for subpages.

Breakdown of conditions:

pathname === item.route â†’ Direct match

Example:
pathname = "/upcoming"
item.route = "/upcoming"
âœ… Match.
pathname.startsWith(\${item.route}/`)` â†’ Sub-route match

Example:
pathname = "/recordings/123"
item.route = "/recordings"
âœ… This ensures /recordings is active even for /recordings/123.

Final Summary
cn is a helper function combining clsx and tailwind-merge.
It simplifies conditional class names and prevents conflicts.
Used in NavBar to dynamically style active links. ðŸš€
